### SUPER WIP (the code is bad)
This is a command-line tool written in Rust for managing and searching locally stored associations between human-readable names and onion (.onion) website links.

Features
- Create associations: Add new name-link associations to your local storage.
- Search for links: Find onion links by their associated names.
- Simple and user-friendly: Interact with the tool through intuitive commands.
- Offline functionality: Works without an internet connection (searches local data).

Note: This tool does not access the dark web or retrieve information from onion links. It solely manages user-provided associations for easier access to bookmarked sites.
